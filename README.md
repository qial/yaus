Yet Another URL Shortener

YAUS is a simple URL Shortener based on php with a mysql backend. I wrote it because I think URL shorteners
are an incredibly cool idea and I wanted one of my own to mess around with. The name was used because I 
also like YAML, but am not clever enough to think of my own acronym. Also yaus.me was open. I felt it had a
nice ring to it.
